Replying to: `You cooked for the points game. Sent the eth GG!`\n \n thank you sir! figured i'd short racer a little this week and as the only one to do so it paid off!
"Someone on spaces last night was talking about BLUR + Paradigm. Those that farmed heavily made 7 - 8 figures, moderately, high 6 figures, even myself who maybe farmed for a week made like $5k.\n \n Now imagine Friend Tech, Base Chain's biggest W launching a token in the heat of the bull market post halving in 2024? People have left the app because they're worried about Sim Swap, wanted to 100% re deploy to other forks, play some altcoins etc.\n \n IMO if you are here, you will be rewarded - deploy as you wish, never be too over exposed but I am extremely bullish on Friend Tech... especially having tried all of the other SoFi apps and doing quite well. I see nearly all of that money flowing back into here, and if not? They'll probably wish they did when a token drops.\n \n Now, with that being said.... find KEYS that are adding to your YIELD by sharing their points. If you do not own CBB, that is probably a great place to start. If you only have one herro key and want more exposure to FT airdrop? Well - 2-3 keys gets you a higher % share of the points.\n \n Anyway, seeing lots of doom messages on Stars Arena, also sentiment on NBC about it getting stale.... we're going to be so back on this next APP update. Farm n Chill."
@pepXBT\n oh they using me as EL on tokensight lol
and cl20 stood for hexanitrohexazaisowurtzitane (hopefully theres no typo here)
is also part of the lore where hazmat came from
Replying to: `Gmeow. What does CL stand for?`\n \n ^
"but then academia while was cats old passion and hobby, it made no money for cat, so cat decided to trade on bitmex"
he then asked cat to come to US to take a full phd scholarship phd in mat-sci specifically focused on explosives and propulsion chemistry

"cl technically stands for china lake, a military base in LA, CL fascility is part of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), famous along alside of ALNL, these 2 labs have big material science / comp chem / explosive departments"

"Replied Message from 5404720455: @unipcstgbot should i rotate my floki into token?\n \n @unipcstgbot \n Why not hold both? \n \n FLOKI is becoming hyper deflationary due to token, and $TOKEN will send hard soon which boosts APY and get more people staking FLOKI for 3 - 48 months to farm it.\n \n APY was $36 million in 15 hours and keeps going up:\n \n https://twitter.com/RealFlokiInu/status/1718212222260814064\n \n Floki supply shock happening while many retarded people are shorting it using leverage on Binance.\n \n Meanwhile several catalysts are lined up for Floki:\n \n - Possible Elon's Halloween tweet. He always tweets holidays.\n - Doge-1 mission next month so doge rallies and pulls the dog memes. Floki has always outperformed all due to not being as liquid, being a smaller cap, and being on retail exchanges like Binance and OKX.\n - $TOKEN's success will draw more people to Floki \n \n I think both are underrated and I've not sold a single floki but locked for a long time to farm TOKEN while I also bought 6 figs of TOKEN Yesterday. Easy money!"

"Replying to: `gmeow 0x5f, ik cbb runs a bot which auto sells if there are more than X sales in a short period of time for someone, clam might have decided to do something similar too`\n \n Ah right that’s true. Or if certain people sell. I should probably expand the logic on mine"
"🔥Bharat Krymo on points🤓:\n While I don’t understand the point mechanics and the rather dynamic changes week to week…I’m bullish on the fact that Racer and team are indeed listening. He’s obviously looking at multiple personas 1) whales (ETH deployers), 2) content creators (in room and cross room grinders). This is good news. What you want is some level of ‘egalitarianism’ for a network or application like this to take flight. In the middle you have what is probably the largest segment…the farmers + producers hybrid. All in all this is a typical bell curve distribution and the right way to foster long term network value. I’m bullish. ✊"

"Replying to: `yah ppe was low for me this week but then i know the whales got rekt hard in the prior couple of weeks - like you said, it's a delicate balancing act, they just need to keep shifting the points formula each week to keep everyone happy (for as long as they can lol)`\n \n exactly. I know for a fact the majority shares the same opinion. Onward and forward."
"🤡Art on $BONK😆:\n BONK has been ripping hard. It's been rumored that they partnered with DWF for market making but I haven't seen any confimation. I tp'd all of mine already but might get in again if opportunity arises. So far meme coins on Perps have been doing extremely well (Pepe, Floki, Bonk). Think buying some of those on pullbacks isn't a bad startegy so far. Look at floki it made almost another 30% from the dip I think\n https://friend.tech/art_xbt"
"Investing is never a straight line. I had a thesis in FT, and part of that succeeded and other parts didn’t. Especially in difficult times, I hv to revisit my original thesis and think if the underlying logic still holds true. But if I am fundamentally right, difficult times always yield the greatest return in hindsight."

"Social comparison is not helpful. For examplec CBB and I hv similar port value but he got 100 ppe and I got 80. But I know I am earning a great return for myself already. There will always be ppl who earn more ppe than you. As long as you are sticking to your own game plan, I think you will end up doing really well."
Replying to: `FT team starting to fumble the bag?!`\n \n Totally fair to hv doubts. But its usually these moments that present the greatest opportunity.
Replying to: `Fuck points were disappointing af`\n \n Damn
Replying to: `How are you feeling about removing the nerf on self buying?`\n \n I think its fine as a temporary relief. Did see some users who are disappointed that FT give whales more ppe. The team needs to comfort those players next week. You can never satisfy everyone so its always a balancing act.

"@biddingman\n Still waiting for the trigger database to populate, we may not launch until tomorrow.  \n \n Also, we have identified a potential security issue not so much on our side, but with the fact that we currently use Twitter for authentication.  We can either postpone for a couple of days to implement more secure authentication, which nobody seems to want, or you can all assume the risk.  Using Twitter for authentication - alone - exposes us theoretically to the same types of issues that FT had.  \n \n Obviously my vote would be to do the right thing here, but I’m being pushed by several parties to just plow ahead and hope nothing happens.  So we’ll let you know in the morning."

"Replying to: `Out of curiosity, why did you close sol? `\n \n Friend of mine positioned on the other side and he's a really scary counterpart. He trade intraday and I noticed SOL was getting faded very easily in the consolidation. Also Bitboy naming himself the Sultan of Solana lmao. And generally the fact that I've been bullish on it since $20, so felt a bit greedy to hold onto it as the trade was becoming quite contentious. I'd never sell spot for the foreseeable future though."
"Actually. People are used to associated negative funding with bullish (because that's where you must buy), and high funding to bearish (because that's where you must sell). However, low funding means a cold market, slightly neutral funding means the market is warming up. Ideally, I would like to see funding rates a little higher across the board, while prices keep going up."

"good to note how many points you have right now so can work it out for the week,  as no record any longer"
good luck on points everyone I think about to receive them any moment..
One great thing about thorchain is I think it is the only way left on-chain to go between real bitcoin and wBTC. I used renBTC a lot in the past and miss that utility.
"Replying to: `Nice. Not a fan of THORChain I suppose (I'm not fully caught up on ur lore yet lmao)`\n \n I held $RUNE early 2019-2021, that was one of my 100x'ers thanks to degenspartan but I haven't reentered, maybe I should look again"

At first glance that may have felt pricey, but I knew the plushie has been hugged by you so the value of said plushie was quite high. Anyways, I voted for the medium option of like $897.69 cuz I wanted a good deal. (Also, ended up not fapping)`\n \n what ? @inversebrah"

Some features may not be available instantly, but will pop up as they come online.  Most of what we have publicly disclosed should be available.  We were looking at letting everyone in the dashboard tonight, but with no features enabled, it would probably lead to more questions that we don't need to waste time answering, since they'll be answered as soon as we turn the features on.

"Or maybe we get lucky and it sustains price like UNI even without revenue, I have no idea how UNI has kept its value."
Replying to: `gm cyi. what do you think of the team implementing multipliers at the end of the farming period? e.g a positive bonus for holding keys until the very end or a negative effect for rugging or bailing on the platform early. It doesn't make any sense for the team to reward scammers and people who've abandoned the app so I would just zero out their points at the end `\n \n Sounds good. Even better are further seasons beyond the 6 months so people keep earning the yield when FT in circulation. Then the token needs access to the revenue to sustain price. I hope that can happen but they will need think carefully how structure it so it doesn't appear as a security.

@dunks411\n ok so cancel withdrawl really just means if he decides to lock it longer than 180 days
@dunks411\n at what point does it become irreversible?
@lunast12\n Yea as soon as he calls locknft it’s locked for atleast 180days I think
@muupwuup\n Yes 180d minimum supposedly
@dunks411\n hmmm
@dunks411\n ok so this contract can lock the LP
@muupwuup\n Sorry was looking at it on mobile
@lunast12\n Yeah
@muupwuup\n Cos trigger has the be called again

Replying to: `gm cyi`\n \n Good morning. Wow app so much better today. Faster.
"Replying to: `CYI, yes I’m trying to stay engaged on FT. I’m enjoying the long yield grind. So glad I came to FT ‘early’ and found your chat. I appreciate the content. I can’t find relevant FT content like yours and your holders anywhere else.  `\n \n Thanks. In 2020-21 my strategy was right at the cutting edge of everything emerging - I was pretty much first one into all the chains, BSC, AVAX, FTM and many others. That was hugely profitable 3 fig yields on top of tokens which went up 10x or even many 100x. I'd cycled all that out into mainly BTC ETH in 2022. Holding those with slight leverage longs until I can see more clarity on the bull strategy for 2024-2025 is clearer. Hoping FT is one part of this bull strategy and $FT is a multibillion token, perhaps it will be as one of very few things which is completely new and different from 2020-21. But mainly in BTC/ETH until clearer. I won't sell BTC/ETH but will simply use a few more dollars from extra borrowing as their prices go up to play around into 2024."

Did NBC really get rid of TVL in the main screen once it started going down
Replying to: `what's your thought on this week's average ppe for active accounts?`\n \n Has to be significantly higher. I’m curious if I’ll still be top 3 or not. Levi and Cbb topped me but ding and some others were just below me. My port feels like relatively it got shot down more than most so I may drop a bit

"Replying to: `You have an idea on who Gwart is?`\n \n good question, probably a unique account (if it was an alt I would guess either blockhead, racer, LinXBT...?)"
Replying to: `Happy Snapshot Day! whats the news?  I think the FT team needs to provide more points to those standing on this week!`\n \n well technically if TVL is down a bit we might get more points-per-eth... but portfolio value is down too so not sure haha

Replying to: `is BBC and 9inch linked?`\n \n yes. BBC is the rewards token
"🔥Jimbol on web3 social🤓:\n 1. Concerning web3 identity, I sense a shift. Instead of identifying people by the PFP they use on social media, we're moving towards understanding individuals based on their behavior on FT. And This helps us get to know them on a more profound level, beyond just the NFTs they own. Since we're all actively involved here, regardless of our individual purposes, it compels us to invest more time and attention to relationships, especially with those we share mutual connections or ""keys"" with. We are forming a more diverse and strong bonding community here. If we were to integrate the credibility system you discussed with 0x5f, it would elevate this experience even further.\n \n 2. Previously, our capacity to engage with specific social circles – ones we're familiar with and are most interested in – was limited. Now, thanks to FT, we can easily identify and connect with key individuals who can help bridge those gaps. This is also advantageous for our project, allowing us to reach our target audience more effectively.\n \n 3. Potentially, this could redefine the format of future social, gaming, and metaverse products. In the past, there have been several attempts to adapt or replicate successful web2 products and transition them into the web3 space. While the immediate assumption was to focus on achieving mass adoption – aiming to engage as many people as possible simultaneously – I believe it's worth reflecting on our everyday experiences. Often, the most enjoyable parties, events, or games involve smaller, more intimate groups. In this context, FT provides valuable insights, enabling us to reassess and refine the next steps for our ecosystem. I believe these insights will undoubtedly benefit other developers and creators as well."

"On something more substantive, let me comment on SNX (which is my biggest holding after BTC and ETH). Yield 35.77% APR this week. Quite a lot of it real yield repaying the sUSD loan.

👨🏻‍🌾CYI on SNX🤔:\n let me comment on SNX (which is my biggest holding after BTC and ETH). Yield 35.77% APR this week. Quite a lot of it real yield repaying the sUSD loan. As institutional funds come in probably more likely the 'investors' buy tokens like $SNX (which they can explain to their bosses) rather than $PEPE. I will be HODLing $SNX at least a couple more years.
Could be good to stay in
maybe goes to stakers

"@5404720455\n 1. Loli - Young girl/Young-looking girl; age neutral; SFW by default. Its also used to describe a body type, age is ignored.\n \n Its an abbreviation of Japanese colloquial word ""Lolita"", which has exactly the same meaning defined above. (Don't confuse it with the twisted American definition of ""Lolita"".)"
@pepXBT\n Pretty sure it is cuz he liked the other Voldemort tweet

I find X better at delivering fast info bc its algo surfaces the most viewed content. Whereas you hv to search for content on FT and a lot of times you don’t find things you want immediately.
"It doesn’t rlly pay to try and predict every move majors make and how they get to a place, just assess what is currently happening and play that"
hold spot btc eth find good alt plays add to stack same as all year
Replying to: `whats your feeling here rhino? feels like the move over the last 7 days has mostly run out of momentum`\n \n Sideways is likely and you jus wanna long strong alts at range lows
Replying to: `Nice ft bullpost we need more and soon you’ll be top 10 again`\n \n Spread the word
the people don’t know how absurd it was to be bearish at the start of the bear after the most intense bull in history
"Replying to: `yea followed since jewel, but to be completely honest didn't pay attention to anything you wrote until that march-april '22 period when everyone was screaming aths and you were one of the v few bears hah`\n \n Yeah 2022 was my magnum opus man"

"Most rooms are just scams - they have all of the same bot/frontrunning problems since they use the same contract with minor modifications. Activity not as high there. More spam/less moderation in room since it's not asymmetric chat. I think it will be really interesting because it will be a way to gauge what activity, fees and market clearing prices are for a similar product without a token/farming game going on. I'm bullish socialfi working even after farming games, but market obv looks very different without a token."
"Levi just mentioned it in his room. I suspect TVL will pop off there today. Again, no airdrop there most likely. As always, I may dump on you. This is the first fork I've used. FT still in pole position but having a competitor with no token would be great point of comparison/forcing function to ship value to users. Less steep bonding curve and no token will appeal to different type of user, and of course it will attract some people who cope from missing out on FT. Since all transactions are on chain, both can index and build on trade activity on the other contract if they want."

My view for todays space
"$PRISMA - I continue to have my eye on this and token is now out next week. It was a 2 month farm (launched September 1st) and I'd say it had an average TVL of $55mm throughout the 2 months. They are releasing 3% of the token to early point farmooooors and veCRV holders, and depending on the split of those (I'm gonna say 50/50 for now) point farmers could be getting 4.5mm PRISMA tokens? Obviously this changes based on what they decide. At a pessimistic valuation (FDV) of $100mm (Lybra is at $100mm) it's a $1.5mm airdrop for 2 months of work. That's also means a circulating mcap on launch of ~$3mm which seems really low ($PRISMA = $0.33).  That comes out to 16.3% APR (pessimistically) on the value of your ETH. I think it could definitely start trading higher but not too bad! \n \n Weeks 1-4: 2,250,000 tokens per week.\n \n Weeks 5-13: 1.2% of the remaining emission tokens per week.\n \n Weeks 14-26: 1% the remaining emission tokens per week.\n \n For weeks 1 through 4, the tokens getting released per week with the above assumptions should lead to farming APR on Prisma to be around ~50% per vault, so we should significant inflows which should kickstart the flywheel\n \n https://twitter.com/PrismaFi/status/1717541760724008966"

"🧠Cobie on memcoin’s role in this cycle🤓:\n Probably the same as previous cycles — almost zero role (except one or two large consensus ones like Doge was) UNTIL the market is extremely overextended (or the run has ended entirely) and they are some last hurrah, a game of chicken for people who are still desperate for a chart to go up."
"💎Makesy shares new SocialFi project😆:\n https://zapper.xyz/chat\n \n friendtech clone except it's a group chat like discord and the 5% fee is shared across all keyholders. Zapper team is legit and they will ship new features fast, but unlikely to have airdrop. Already have a lot of good functionality in their chat client and have the profile/on chain wallet tracking infra built already"
"☕️Steven on his on-chain strategy🤔:\n Giving up following Frax for now. Market simply doesn't care. FRAX still losing market share against DAI. No one likes sfrxETH despite it being the highest yield LST (you can see this with how fast the vault caps are taken on Prisma). Pools are getting imbalanced again. sFRAX is interesting/nice but it's slow weekly epochs may result in market taking a while to appreciate it. Also I feel like most holders in this chat have no idea what I'm talking about here and that's exactly the problem\n \n With volumes coming back SNX might be an interesting play, esp with Infinex farming. GMX too with Arb incentives. Would put DYDX in this bucket but I still feel like v4 is mostly sell the news\n \n Overall even tho I'm punting on these names through perps I think the upside is finding onchain opportunities where institutional funds can't allocate to and being able to structure it appropriately. A few examples lately:\n - Deposit USDC, borrow ETH, buy wNXM. A few months ago this was a ~60% IRR strategy\n - Buy OHM below book value, wait for cooler loans to come out, borrow against 95% of book value at 0.5% APR. Pretty much free call option on OHM and Berachain\n - Since the alfa is eroded with a few large players coming in the pool now, my strategy with AKT was to borrow OSMO against USDC on Mars, swap half the AKT, then deposit in Osmosis pool. The pool was heavily incentivized with very low TVL last month. All in this was yielding 80%+ APR for a few solid weeks while gaining upside to AKT. Seems like more people found out about it the last few days though :( Might jeet from this strategy now\n \n The downside with these plays (and where you're earning your return from) is lack of liquidity\n https://friend.tech/stevenshi_"

"Replying to: `If we’re entering a bull market and have another cycle, what role do you think meme coins will play in it?`\n \n Probably the same as previous cycles — almost zero role (except one or two large consensus ones like Doge was) UNTIL the market is extremely overextended (or the run has ended entirely) and they are some last hurrah, a game of chicken for people who are still desperate for a chart to go up."

Replied Message from unipcstgbot: Thanks for giving me hopium. I guess I will take half of at ATH and leave the rest for it possibly going to 1 - 2 billion.\n \n @OxGabb \n yeah layering out makes sense if your position is large
@unipcstgbot\n Most major coins/chains have a major memecoin
@unipcstgbot\n One thing I'm sure of is Solana will be a major coin this cycle and much more successful than last

"@OxGabb\n doge ath was 89b, shib ath was 42b, I think 1-2b is an easy target for the most retail friendly chain"

"Replied Message from unipcstgbot: Is this based on the current market holding? I'd be surprised if it doesn't break another 0 tbh and I won't even think of closing my position until it does that. It probably goes much higher, as its kind of like the beta play for Solana. It has exploded aggressively before in a way that captures mindshare, and it has the advantage of low unit bias which attracts retail. \n \n My real target for BONK is ATH if the memecoin run starts, and tbh that hasn't started yet: the only movers have been FLOKI which is up 2x from last week's lows and PEPE, which is up like 60%. With the exception of those two, we've only seen hpos, spx, joe, and other new on-chain memecoins run. DOGE and SHIB have barely blinked. They need to pull at least a 2x, a lot more even, for one to say we've had a meme run. When that happens Bonk and all the smaller ones will run higher, and until that happens I'm not closing my long.\n \n FWIW my risk tolerant is high. If it comes to it I don't mind losing half or more of my gains if it increases my chances of earning significantly more compared to where I am now. Bybit shows at if Bonk hit ATH again I will have a profit of ~$2 million from my longs. If it crabs I probs go back down to $50k or $40k or whatever. I'm happy to take that risk!\n \n @OxGabb \n sick - agree"
@unipcstgbot\n Idk tbh I'm just a Floki maxi kek
"Replied Message from unipcstgbot: Speaking of Floki, it is the most fundamentally stronger memecoin IMO and I'm not sure why many keep fading it. With staking launching this weekend, where users earn another token, which means there are no Floki emissions and much of the supply gets locked, all while memes are about to start an epic run. \n \n Without any sort of catalyst that alone should make Floki outperform other memes, but they have several catalysts including the mainnet launch of their flagship metaverse game this year. 🤷‍♀️\n \n @unipcstgbot \n Also Elon posting a picture of Floki on Halloween isn't out of the picture, which has helped it pump hard historically. This time around it would be with Floki listed on Binance and less sell pressure based on staking."

"Replied Message from rightcalibre: Thanks for ur insights 😎 may the ATH hit and we eat well\n \n @unipcstgbot \n If I wasn't long here with leverage I would be careful personally fwiw. While these rallies tend to go explosively higher, and I think it does, the sharp pullbacks as people take profits before it goes higher will liquidate most late longs.\n \n The beauty of it is many will see the giant candles and short as well, but retail FOMO is crazy and they will mostly get liquidated and fuel the pump further which induces more FOMO. Same happened with Floki Yesterday where over $400k in shorts was wiped out in 15 minutes and it got a 30% candle in 15 minutes as a result."
