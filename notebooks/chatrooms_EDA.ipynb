Today we funded a wallet dedicated for revenue share and another one that is our treasury.\n\n**Rev Share**: ordinscriptionbot-revshare.eth\n**Treasury**: ordinscriptionbot-treasury.eth\n\nWe just transfered 32 ETH to the revenue share wallet! And this first share will be splitted among holders this Friday, December 8th.\n\n**72k USD shared between holders**, we are so happy with this announcement on project day one.\n\nWe gonna have a dApp later, so you can check how much you will receive i.e. if you hold 1% of $OIB supply, you will receive around 720 USD. Amount subject to change, we will collect more funds till Friday,etc You need to hold at least 0.1% Token supply to be elegible for rev share.\n\nHope you all like this news, lets keep building! We will rest for today, and tomorrow we have some bot updates for you. GN\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x74c675aef5068df34cf6fbfc68be6a9e9d322c7ccfd246a0e4efb773ccc44c36"

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine if it's a pullback in a downtrend or the beginning of a bullish trend.\n- The chart does not include key moving averages, indicators, or volume data, which limits comprehensive technical analysis.\n\nBased solely on the given data, a definitive bullish or bearish signal cannot be established. For more in-depth analysis, additional information such as historical price action, volume, and other technical indicators would be required."

You just need to utilize tools and be wise to get in plays early.\n\nEven if you make 500 SOL. That is 7 figs next cycle. If you make 1k+, you're gucci.\n\nNot to mention even mid-peak cycle all ecosystem plays will also pump another 20x+, you're getting another 20x on top. \n\nDon't be a fucking retard and fade Solana.

Apechain is also one of our valued partners in this journey.\n\nWe want to clarify that we used the Apechain Contract developer to fork the Apechain contract. Our aim was to make it bot-resistant at launch by implementing a single transaction per block limit. Unfortunately, the developer mistakenly did not remove the Twitter handle.\n\nThank you for your understanding. We also want to announce that we will release the ETH-SC bridge within the next 24-36 hours.\"\n\n@sherpagmi Do you buy this explaination, or is it a whole load of BS in your eyes ? Thanks 🙂"

Everyone can easily access all parts of this ecosystem and do cross payments from one place, FameGuild protocol. \n\nThe flare, we are showcasing all these features using a new type of Ordinals collection, we call it FamelHiem collection, a collection of 100 characters. \n\n**More about the FamelHiem collection**\n\nIt's a story, the first ever story told using a Blockchain, I'm happy that it's in the Bitcoin blockchain itself. \n\nIt's a story where Holders of the characters can determine it's fate, they determine what each character will do using onchain votes with their Ordinals. \n\nAfter the votes are made, our team of expert artists(ex-disney and more) will convert them into comics, animated mini movies and eventually animated movies and games. \n\nI'll share some sneak peak below."

           "Yo everyone, Kaliber here, \n\nI've been silent for a few days, and for a good reason. I have been working hard on 🔥the web version of Paw-a-Gotchi🔥. So in order to shed some light on the future of the project, let me tell you some initial details about it.\n\nWe are developing the web version of Paw-a-Gotchi in parallel with the Unreal version in order not to slow down our progress in the roadmap. The web version is developed in html 5 and can be accessed from our Dapp by anyone with a Paw-a-Gotchi account. The web version will not replace the Unreal one but is designed to be used more like a companion app. However, it will be entirely possible to enjoy all the features of Paw-a-Gotchi from the web version alone, so that players who cannot play the windows version can still participate in all P2E features. \n\nAlso, in order to speed up the integration of main P2E features, we decided to deliver some features like the shop and the dog competitions (racing/fighting) in the web version first. In the windows version, instead we will focus on currency integration and fun activities to earn them to offer something in the windows version only the Unreal Engine can deliver. We think that this way we will be able to better keep our players engaged. Don't forget that the Growth Point leaderboards is a temporary P2E mechanic until the main P2E features are integrated and GP will be used in the future to level up your pet and get it stronger for competitions.\n\nSo yeah, we are hard at work and appreciate everyone who not only sees Paw-a-Gotchi as what it is, but also what it can become in the future.\n\nI'll share more info and screens as soon as possible, see you until then.🫡"

If this feature is applied widely, the normie will come easier because they don't need to deal with seed phrases anymore. Still have to be careful with the scam websites though. \n\nA competitor is Blacksmith ($BS). They started many months ago. There is no product yet because of multiple delays due to technical difficulties, but the dev has released screenshots and nuggets along. It seems to be close to being complete.  I was able to see the AA working on chain. So they are really working on this project. \n\nOverall, TKST is safer because the team is doxxed.

There's a spaces host by the name of 51 on X who is working with other OG's to revive this thing and send it. It might be a great opportunity with the $GROK tie. I'm in and gonna wait and see how mich momentum we can get. At like 50k MC right now, if it can get moving, the upside potential is enormous."

I found something like that, do you agree?\n\n**+2% Depth:**\n-This indicator shows how much capital (in dollars or other currency) is needed to increase the price of a specific cryptocurrency by 2%.\n- If \"+2% Depth\" is $145, it means that buying cryptocurrencies worth $145 is sufficient to raise the price of that currency by 2%.\n- This measure reflects the market liquidity from the buyers’ side – a lower value indicates less liquidity.\n\n**-2% Depth:**\n- Conversely, \"-2% Depth\" indicates how much capital is required to decrease the price of a cryptocurrency by 2%.\n- If \"-2% Depth\" is $7000, then selling cryptocurrencies worth $7000 will decrease the price by 2%.\n- This is an indicator of market liquidity from the sellers’ side – a lower value here also means less liquidity."

However dev is a shiba bajillionaire who prompted AI which then completely generated the entire token, contract, image, ticker, name, supply etc etc. its the first fully deployed like this. This is croissant.eth ai bot which is still in live beta.\n\nCommunity left are keen to have people here for cultural purposes only and the bajillionaire dev is keen to support culturally, he didn’t intend for it to explode to 500 people and Neo jeet followers to flood in. He was actually quite taken back by it 😂 \n\nCommunity have reached to croissant for support and pepe x. Looking for more people to come and vibe. Grok coming up which will make AI sexy again. Price is extremely cheap rn, i am not buying any more as i already have bought. \n\n@ElSolsticio if you know any culture callers we can reach out to I am all ears please.

Now it has been sitting with around $430K liquidity for hours and barely any activity in the TG - I would normally expect this to trigger people to start dumping hard, but they are not.
